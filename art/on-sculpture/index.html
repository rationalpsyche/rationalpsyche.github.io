<p>‘Enough statues to fill a graveyard!&rsquo;<br>
‘Please, Ben. ‘Statues‘ are dead politicians at boulevard inter-<br>
sections. What you see is ‘sculpture.‘ And please speak in a low,<br>
reverent tone lest I become violent&hellip; for here we have exact<br>
replicas of some of the greatest sculpture this naughty globe has<br>
produced.&rsquo;<br>
‘Well, that hideous thing I&rsquo;ve seen before&hellip; but when did you<br>
acquire the rest of this ballast?&rsquo;<br>
Jubal ignored him and spoke quietly to the replica of La Belle<br>
Heaulmière. ‘Do not listen to him, ma petite chére — he is a bar-<br>
barian and knows no better.&rsquo; He put his hand to her beautiful<br>
ravaged cheek, then gently touched one empty, shrunken dug. ‘I<br>
know just how you feel&hellip; but it can&rsquo;t be very much longer.<br>
Patience, my lovely.'</p>
<p>He turned back to Caxton and said briskly, ‘Ben, I don&rsquo;t know<br>
what you have on your mind but it will have to wait while I give<br>
you a lesson in how to look at sculpture — though it&rsquo;s probably as<br>
useless as trying to teach a dog to appreciate the violin. But you&rsquo;ve<br>
been rude to a lady&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t tolerate that.&rsquo;<br>
[&hellip;]<br>
Anne looked carefully at Rodin&rsquo;s masterpiece [The Old Courtesan<br>
(La Belle qui fut heaulmière)], then said slowly,<br>
‘When I first saw it, I thought it was horrible. But I have come to<br>
the conclusion that it may be the most beautiful thing I have ever<br>
seen.&rsquo;<br>
‘Thanks. That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; She left. ‘Do you want to argue it, Ben?&rsquo;<br>
‘Huh? When I argue with Anne, that&rsquo;s the day I turn in my suit.&rsquo;<br>
Ben looked at it. ‘But I don&rsquo;t get it.'</p>
<p>‘All right, Ben. Attend me. Anybody can look at a pretty girl<br>
and see a pretty girl. An artist can look at a pretty girl and see<br>
the woman she will become. A better artist can look at an old<br>
woman and see the pretty girl that she used to be. But a great artist<br>
—a master — and that is what Auguste Rodin was — can look at<br>
an old woman, portray her exactly as she is&hellip; and force the viewer<br>
to see the pretty girl she used to be&hellip; and more than that, he can<br>
make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo, or even you, see<br>
that this lovely young girl is still alive, not old and ugly at all, but<br>
the prisoned inside her ruined body. He can make you feel the<br>
quiet, endless tragedy that there was never a girl born who ever<br>
grew older than eighteen in her heart&hellip; no matter what the mer-<br>
ciless hours have done to her. Look at her, Ben. Growing old<br>
doesn&rsquo;t matter to you and me; we were never meant to be admired<br>
—but it does to them. Look at her!'</p>
<p>Ben looked at her. Presently Jubal said gruffly, ‘All right, blow<br>
your nose and wipe your eyes — she accepts your apology. Come<br>
on and sit down. That&rsquo;s enough for one lesson.&rsquo;<br>
‘No,&rsquo; Caxton answered, ‘I want to know about these others.<br>
How about this one? It doesn&rsquo;t bother me as much&hellip; I can see<br>
it&rsquo;s a young girl, right off. But why tie her up like a pretzel?&rsquo;<br>
Jubal looked at the replica ‘Caryatid Who has Fallen under the<br>
Weight of her Stone&rsquo; and smiled. ‘Call it a tour de force in empathy,<br>
Ben. I won&rsquo;t expect you to appreciate the shapes and masses which<br>
make that figure much more than a ‘pretzel‘ — but you can appre-<br>
ciate what Rodin was saying. Ben, what do people get out of<br>
looking at a crucifix?'</p>
<p>‘You know how much I go to church.&rsquo;<br>
‘How little you mean. Still, you must know that, as craftsmanship,<br>
paintings and sculpture of the Crucifixion are usu-<br>
ally atrocious — and the painted, realistic ones often used in<br>
churches are the worst of all&hellip; the blood looks like catsup and<br>
that ex-carpenter is usually portrayed as if he were a pansy&hellip;<br>
which He certainly was not if there is any truth in the four Gospels<br>
at all. He was a hearty man, probably muscular and of rugged<br>
health. But despite the almost uniformly poor portrayal in rep-<br>
resentations of the Crucifixion, a poor one is about as effective as<br>
a good one for most people. They don&rsquo;t see the defects; what they<br>
see is a symbol which inspires their deepest emotions; it recalls to<br>
them the Agony and Sacrifice of God.'</p>
<p>‘Jubal, I thought you weren&rsquo;t a Christian?&rsquo;<br>
‘What&rsquo;s that got to do with it? Does that make me blind and<br>
deaf to fundamental human emotion? I was saying that the crum-<br>
miest painted plaster crucifix or the cheapest cardboard Christmas<br>
Crèche can be sufficient symbol to evoke emotions in the human<br>
heart so strong that many have died for them and many more live<br>
for them. So the craftsmanship and artistic judgment with which<br>
such a symbol is wrought are largely irrelevant. Now here we have<br>
another emotional symbol — wrought with exquisite craftsman-<br>
ship, but we won&rsquo;t go into that, yet.</p>
<p>Ben, for almost three thousand<br>
years or longer, architects have designed buildings with columns<br>
shaped as female figures — it got to be such a habit that they did it<br>
as casually as a small boy steps on an ant. After all those centuries<br>
it took Rodin to see that this was work too heavy for a girl. But he<br>
didn&rsquo;t simply say, ‘Look, you jerks, if you must design this way,<br>
make it a brawny male figure.‘ No, he showed it . . . and generalized<br>
the symbol. Here is this poor little caryatid who has tried — and<br>
failed, fallen under the load. She&rsquo;s a good girl — look at her face.<br>
Serious, unhappy at her failure, but not blaming anyone else, not<br>
even the gods . . . and still trying to shoulder her load, after she&rsquo;s<br>
crumpled under it.</p>
<p>‘But she&rsquo;s more than good art denouncing some very bad art;<br>
she&rsquo;s a symbol for every woman who has ever tried to shoulder a<br>
load that was too heavy for her — over half the female population<br>
of this planet, living and dead, I would guess. But not alone women<br>
this symbol is sexless. It means every man and every woman who<br>
ever lived who sweated out life in uncomplaining fortitude, whose<br>
courage wasn&rsquo;t even noticed until they crumpled under their loads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s courage, Ben, and victory.&rsquo;<br>
‘Victory?&rsquo;<br>
‘Victory in defeat, there is none higher. She didn&rsquo;t give up, Ben;<br>
she&rsquo;s still trying to lift that stone after it has crushed her. She&rsquo;s a<br>
father going down to a dull office job while cancer is painfully<br>
eating away his insides, so as to bring home one more pay check<br>
for the kids. She&rsquo;s a twelve-year-old girl trying to mother her baby<br>
brothers and sisters because Mama had to go to Heaven. She&rsquo;s a<br>
switchboard operator sticking to her job while smoke is choking<br>
her and the fire is cutting off her escape. She&rsquo;s all the unsung<br>
heroes who couldn&rsquo;t quite cut it but never quit. Come. Just salute<br>
as you pass her and come see my Little Mermaid.'</p>
<p>Ben took him precisely at his word; if Jubal was surprised, he<br>
made no comment. ‘Now this one,&rsquo; he said, ‘is the only one Mike<br>
didn&rsquo;t give to me. But there is no need to tell Mike why I got it—<br>
aside from the self-evident fact that it&rsquo;s one of the most delightful<br>
compositions ever conceived and proudly executed by the eye and<br>
hand of man.'</p>
<p>‘She&rsquo;s that, all right. This one I don&rsquo;t have to have explained —<br>
it&rsquo;s just plain pretty!&rsquo;<br>
‘Yes. And that is excuse in itself, just as with kittens and butter-<br>
flies. But there is more to it than that . . . and she reminded me of<br>
Mike. She&rsquo;s not quite a mermaid — see? — and she&rsquo;s not quite<br>
human. She sits on land, where she has chosen to stay . . . and she<br>
stares eternally out to sea, homesick and forever lonely for what<br>
she left behind. You know the story?&rsquo;<br>
‘Hans Christian Andersen.&rsquo;<br>
‘Yes. She sits by the harbor of København — Copenhagen was<br>
his home town — and she&rsquo;s everybody who ever made a difficult<br>
choice. She doesn&rsquo;t regret her choice, but she must pay for it; every<br>
choice must be paid for. The cost to her is not only endless home-<br>
sickness. She can never be quite human; when she uses her dearly<br>
bought feet, every step is on sharp knives.</p>
