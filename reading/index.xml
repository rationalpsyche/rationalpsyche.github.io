      <description>To The Rulers Of The World CC: those adverse to them
I strongly despise this money-driven world. Money to have more power or power to have more money, I do not know, probably it is a vicious cycle. Interests, virtual money, this is one of the cancers of our world. I hate the fact the few pricks decide how much your life work is worth. I would like so much to leave for what a close friend of mine called “a small island of virtue” but there is no escape.</description>

      <description>Extracts - Citizen Four Edward Snowden I remember what the Internet was like before it was being watched. And there has never been anything in the history of man like it. I mean you could have children from one part of the world having an equal discussion, where you know they were sort of granted the same respect for their ideas and conversation, with experts in the field from another part of the world on any topic, anywhere, anytime, all the time.</description>

      <description>Extracts - Phrack .:: The fall of hacker groups ::. Hacking is, in its very essence, an underground movement. Those who take part in it have always been the ones who (ab)used technology in ways beyond the knowledge of the larger userbase. It is tightly linked to intense efforts in unveiling previously unknown information as well as in sharing these discoveries.
We live in days of limited creativity. Moreover, as contraditory as it may seem, it looks particularly rare for creativity to arise from groups or teams.</description>
